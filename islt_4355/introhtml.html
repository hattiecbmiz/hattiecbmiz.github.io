     My name is Hattie. I’m a senior at Mizzou studying Anthropology, as well as a communications intern with the College of Arts & Science. I enjoy writing and photography, both of which are skills I use as an intern at the University. Aside from interning at Mizzou, I’m the Social Media Lead for Bridal Cave and Thunder Mountain Park in Camdenton, Missouri. I’m also a staff writer and photographer with the Austin, Texas-based company General Effect Media. I keep myself busy! When I’m not working, I like to spend time with friends and family. My favorite activities include hiking, swimming, baking, and playing video and card games. I’m the oldest of three, plus one 9-year-old Labrador named Misty (after the character from Pokémon). I often write about my experiences with disability, but some of my favorite, less-serious topics include writing about the performing arts, music, and local sports.
